# agent_issuance

This module contains business logic for issuing credentials. This ranges from using a credential template,
applying user-specific subject data to it and offering the credential to a user wallet via the [OpenID4VCI](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) standard protocol.
